				<h3>Introduction</h3>
				<p>
					The video game industry is huge, grossing over an estimated <a href="https://newzoo.com/insights/articles/newzoos-top-100-countries-by-2015-game-revenues/">$90 billion worldwide</a>. Video games are not only for dedicated gamers; cell phones put free games in the hands of nearly everyone. It would be tough to find a person in Canada that has never played a video game. The combination of video games and gambling have not been spoken about much in the media. However, gambling in video games is a real concern. Systems nearly identical to actual forms of gambling from casinos are present in many games and apps available to young people. If someone wants to gamble, they should expect to lose; this is the nature of gambling and how companies make money. The money value you receive from gambling will always be less than the value you invest with your time and money. This website exists to bring attention to underage gambling practices by video game companies. Through the resource list, we discuss what gambling looks like, why it is actually a problem, and what government officials have to say. We also introduce a concept called ‘voting with your wallet’ and discuss where to receive help if gambling or gaming is affecting someone’s well-being.
				</p>
				
				<p>
					Before you view the listed resources, please review two definitions for words of importance to gambling in video games: <br>
				</p>
				<p>
					The first is a microtransaction: an in-game purchase that costs real money is called a microtransaction. Often one purchases other forms of currency that you can use in-game to get more valuable items or lives or speed-up gameplay. Some microtransactions only cost a couple dollars but there are often deals on buying in larger quantities.

				<p>
					The second is a loot box: it is either a reward for spending time playing the game or a microtransaction or both. Loot boxes sometimes cost money to open as well. When opened, they give a small chance to receive rare (desired) items in-game.
