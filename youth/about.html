				<h3>A Critical Reflection</h3>
				<p>
					This website is designed to educate youth about troubling practices that game companies incorporate into their games. Specifically, I describe the ideas of loot boxes and microtransactions as elements of gambling in video games. The target audience should already be aware of these practices because they are systematic inclusions from the most popular game companies: Electronic Arts (EA), Ubisoft, Activision-Blizzard, Valve, and more. These practices actually began in mobile and social media gaming with games such as Candy Crush, Farmville, and Angry Birds. Most games but especially those available freely online and with child-friendly images and themes are targeting children as consumers. When a child playing Farmville is unable to identify that in-game items cost real money or that the value of in-game items is negligible but they cost a lot of money, there is a problem. When that child grows up with these practices that prey on uninformed, addicted, and invested consumers, such as children, that is a problem. Do these practices, that resemble gambling, lead to problem gambling later in life? That much is still undecided but the statement that gambling is an activity of more loss than gain is accurate. Do we really want children - or anyone - to spend money and gain very little from their money and time investments? No, we call that a waste of time. Yet very few policy makers have been concerned with the multi-billion dollar gaming industry. Change needs to happen and regulations need to be brought upon these predatory practices in the tech industry. More importantly, children and parents need to be aware of these practices and identify them across various media.</p>

					<h3>What Gambling Looks Like & Why Gambling Is A Problem</h3>
					
					<p>Take a moment to visualize what a stereotypical video gamer looks like to you. Depending on how you view the topic of gaming, you may be picturing a young male sitting on a couch lazily with a controller in his hands, a child playing with a GameBoy, or even a violent person. These stereotypes are not strictly true; in the USA, the Entertainment Software Association (2017) claims that the average age of a gamer is 35, that 72% of gamers are 18 or older, that gaming is a positive experience in the lives of children according to their parents, and a majority of households contain a gamer. Video gaming is a huge part of our culture.</p>
					
					<p>The saturation of mobile devices, from laptops to phones, and the app marketplaces they use allow nearly anyone to download apps. Some of these apps are games and some of these games are free. If you have played a free mobile game before, such as Candy Crush Saga (2017), you will likely know that the game only lets you play when you have lives and if you lose a round then you lose a life. The game makes you wait for your lives to regenerate or you can buy lives with in-app purchases costing anywhere from $2 to $140. However, buying a life does not mean you will succeed in the next round and you may be forced to buy more lives again to continue. There is an element of probability involved in a match-three game like Candy Crush (2017); it does not depend entirely on skill. This concept has spread to more skill based games in the form of loot boxes that offer a chance at rare items for a sum of money. The most shocking example in the gaming industry of late is a recent STAR WARS game, Battlefront 2 (2017). Precisely the same mechanics are there: you earn points slowly or you can buy them. Except, the rewards now contain game altering items that advantage players in the game that have them; for example, an upgrade that reduces damage taken by 100%, making the player invincible for a time. Therefore, someone in possession of these items now is more likely to win the game. It can take thousands of hours to earn the required upgrades to stay competitive in the game or one can spend money on loot boxes that give a probability (read: no guarantee) of dropping the items you want. The game, by way of tedium, strongly encourages the player to gamble on its loot box system. Battlefront 2 (2017) is rated for children 13 and up. Despite the outcry from gamers for regulation, relatively little has been accomplished worldwide until recently.</p>
					
					<p>Consider the fact that some people, and particularly children, invest a lot of time into video games. I play the game Overwatch (2017) with friends and have invested a lot of time (200 hours in a year of playing). Occasionally an event occurs in the game themed around a holiday and special rewards are made available through limited edition loot boxes. I consider myself very strong willed but because I have made fond memories in the game community and with friends, I feel pressure to purchase loot boxes because I want the items they contain and the time to earn them is limited. I am concerned for children under the influence of these practices because I know first hand how tempting it is to gamble for chance at winning an item I want. I think the comparison of STAR WARS to Joe Camel made in my fourth resource (Lee, 2017) is not strong enough; STAR WARS also induces a feeling of nostalgia and the temptation to spend money to make gains in-game must be near irresistible for kids that grew up with STAR WARS and online video games.</p>
					
					<p>I think it is apparent that these practices are, using the Lee’s (2017) terminology, predatory. They prey on uninformed, addicted, and invested consumers to make money just as gambling does through bright, shiny, and noisy casinos and ticket booths. The action we decide to take to regulate the gaming industry matters. I think society needs to apply the conclusions Moore (2010) expresses about the drug and alcohol consumption culture in Australia. How we perceive gamers and how the media portrays gamers may “obscure the variety, complexity, and strategic nature” of video gaming. We need to be cognizant of the fact that most gamers are over 18; gamers are average people and not only couch potatoes, children, or violent people. Microtransactions help keep gaming communities alive by paying for the employees to keep servers up and updates regular. Informed regulation should reduce the gambling aspects but not necessarily the ability to support the game developers.</p>
					
					<h3>What Can We Do? & How Governments Are Taking Notice</h3>
					
					<p>Video games are already expensive; Battlefront 2 (2017) costs $80 for the standard edition and add to that the cost of any microtransactions. My third resource (Indiejacob, 2015) is a call to boycott the predatory practices of the gaming industry. Voting with your wallet is the most immediately effective protest consumers can levy against large companies. Boycotting requires commitment and organization on consumers and when potentially 28% of gamers are under 18, that is a huge piece of the market to organize. I believe this is the best we can hope for in the short term.</p>
					
					<p>Nonetheless, policy makers across the globe are paying attention slowly. It has almost been a year since China has required game companies to post the probabilities of loot boxes publically (Chalk, 2016). This was perhaps the first mention of loot boxes by policy makers. However, after the release controversy surrounding Battlefront 2 (2017) several more governments have begun to take action. The Netherlands have launched an investigation into the practice (Bailey, 2017) and member of Hawaii House of Representatives Chris Lee (2017) has come out publicly in favour of regulation of predatory practices in gaming. However, I can find no evidence of Canadian politicians having a word on the matter of loot boxes and microtransactions. Therefore, I suggest that anyone visiting my website take the opportunity to voice their concerns with their MP and MPP. I think this is a good opportunity for for young people to be involved in politics in a more meaningful way.</p>
					
					<h3>Where to Get Help</h3>
					
					<p>My final resource is a list of symptoms of addiction to gaming. I include this as a resource because my website’s audience is youth and they may recognize a problem in themselves or a friend before anyone else does. While I do not have the research to back up the claim that loot boxes and microtransactions themselves are addicting, I have the personal experience to say that gaming is a method that young people use to relax and destress. As a gamer and a teacher candidate, I am concerned for those young people that decide to destress with games containing loot boxes and microtransactions. Furthermore, with the prevalence of mobile technology in the classroom, I also see first hand students that spend their class time on mobile games. I think the potential to waste a lot of money on apps and games through gambling is there, so there needs to be support for the few cases where someone cannot control their spending.</p>
					
					<p>My hope is that by encouraging intervention rather than abstinence of microtransactions that students also learn the value of their time and money. Hammond et al. (2015) recommend much the same for drug and alcohol use among young people in Canada because alcohol, cannabis, and tobacco use is a common experience for adolescents. The availability of mobile games and the aforementioned tedium of earning progress in games creates an almost impossible goal for an abstinence strategy. Ultimately, adolescents will become adults and will need to learn how to best spend their money eventually. With the unfortunate state of the gaming industry, there is an opportunity to learn and I believe my resource centre can guide adolescents in a safe, responsible direction for their future. This is a lesson not only against overzealous gaming habits but also gambling habits.
