				<h2>The Church Before the Sea</h2>
				<br>
				<p>
				Cut, rigid, in the desert before the sea, <br>
				swerves the scar of a bitter ice and the cold, <br>
				darkening imprint of time. A lonely old Scots pine<br>
				jets off the rock; a feather could break the hold.<br>
				<br>
				Yards before this precipice and never-ending blue<br>
				stands the land's only church, basking regal red <br>
				as the sun sets into the tormenting sea.<br>
				Reminding and virulent in the thoughts of the dead:<br>
				<br>
				this church, their last sight before blinding<br>
				darkness and the crushing brutality of nothingness,<br>
				harbours only an old man of the godless disposition.<br>
				I found his expressions in rank with the staring abyss.<br>
				<br>
				For his crystalline eyes, though tendered by age,<br>
				spoke of his insipid past. The horridly trivial wanderings<br>
				from past to present expressed a deep depression.<br>
				This old man, I am sure, will dig a grave for his own ponderings.<br>
				<br>
				"Why do you not leave this church on the fjord?" asked I<br>
				one frost-ridden afternoon. His answer resonates in me still:<br>
				"I, despairing of myself, impart hope among these lands," chocked he,<br>
				the man, aged by his own enigma. He, the projection of good will,<br>
				<br>
				died but one fortnight later. His funeral, costly and bittersweet,<br>
				laid him next to his previously burried ponderingss and the mind<br>
				he tortured in the church. That was the day the old Scots pine<br>
				fell from the rocks and into the sea. Life is cleverly unkind.
