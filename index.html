				<h2>Photography Available!</h2>
				<p>
					I am an amateur photographer looking to broaden my craft. Although mainly a nature and lifestyle photographer, I offer my eye for small event and portrait photography. If you are interested in such services please contact me at <b><a href="mailto:k@cluchey.ca">k@cluchey.ca</a></b> with a description of the event or portrait you are requesting. For example, a common request is for a portrait for social media use. This portrait may be professional-looking (such as for LinkedIn) or personal (such as for Facebook/Twitter).
				</p>
				<p>
					My prices are negotiable. I usually ask for $20 per photo delivered (high-res JPEG for personal and non-commercial use) up to five delivered images. After five, depending on the service, we can negotiate other pricing - such as event or photoshoot. I do not print images myself but I will print at a facility of my choice and deliver, if requested.
