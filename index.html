					Mathematics education is my passion.  I believe mathematics is a skill of absolute importance to young people today.  It should be no surprise that I also enjoy tutoring.  I have been a tutor for over three years with experience at all age levels and skill sets.  I currently work for the University of Waterloo as a teacher of the junior Math Circles.  If you are seeking tutoring for grades 8 through 12, first year college or university, you should contact me at <b>kctutor AT dxdy.org</b>.
