				<h2>Distinctions</h2><br>
                <h3>Educator</h3>
                <p>I became a teacher becauce I believe mathematical literacy, a concern for climate change and social responsibility, and a desire to learn are necessary components that our next generation will use to build the world of tomorrow and live happily and healthily.</p>
                <p>I bring my students' diversity of thought and experience into the classroom to activate an inclusive learning environment where student input is well appreciated. My several years of tutoring and teaching experience, from elementary to post-secondary, give me confidence in the subjects I teach and my ability to teach them.</p>
